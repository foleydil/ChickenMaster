5 ways to Cook a Chicken Breast:
1)Marinated & Grilled
2)Chicken Cordon Bleu
3)Breaded Chicken Tenders
4)Boneless Chicken Wings
5)Fried Chicken

My app "Chicken Master" will teach the user five different ways to cook a chicken breast. The app will give the user a topic
in the form of a chicken-based dish, provide basics of how to prepare that dish, and then ask the user to answer a question.
The user won't be allowed to progress onto the next topic until they've answered the previous question correctly. The app
will utilize buttons to "navigate" across topics, as well as check-boxes to allow the user to answer the quiz questions.
