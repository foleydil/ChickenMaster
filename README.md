# ChickenMaster
Final Project for Android For Beginners Udacity class

The purpose of the Chicken Master application is to educate the user on key elements of preparing chicken in five different ways, through the use of quiz questions.

The app opens onto the first question, and doesn't allow the user to continue until they've selected the radio button corresponding to the correct answer and clicked the "Next" button. Upon entering a wrong answer and clicking "Next," the user receives a Toast to "Try again." Upon answering correctly and clicking "Next," the user receives an confirmation Toast and progresses to the next quetsion. Once all five questions have been answered correctly, the user received a congratulations screen and is given a "Start Over" button as an option to return to the start.

Each question contains an image of the chicken style, a title, quetsion, 3 potential responses with corresponding radio buttons, and a "Next" navigatio button. Questions 2-5 also offer a "Prev" button to allow the user to return to the previous quetsion. 

The app is optimized for smartphones and other small devices. Spacing, text, images, and button sizes make for a less user-friendly experience when run on a tablet.
